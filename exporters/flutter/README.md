[Supernova](https://supernova.io) is a design system platform that manages your assets, tokens, components and allows you to write spectacular documentations for your entire teams. And because you found your way here, you are probably interested in its most advanced functionality - automatic hand-off of design and development assets, tokens and data in general. To learn everything Supernova, please check out our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/).


# Flutter Exporter


The Flutter Exporter allows you to **produce production-ready code for all product styles (such as colors) defined inside your design system** in such a way that you can immediately use them to style your application elements. Specifically, this exporter automates the coding of:

- [x] Color definitions
- [x] Text Styles
- [x] Gradients
- [x] Shadows
- [x] Borders
- [x] Radii
- [x] Measures

The exporter will generate a class per style type with a static constant for each specific token. If provided, it will also include each token's description as a documentation comment. Here's an example of the exporter ouput for a single `11 Regular Italic` text style under a `Text` group:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class AppTextStyles {

  static const text11RegularItalic = TextStyle(
    fontFamily: "Poppins",
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
    fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,
    fontSize: 11,
    decoration: TextDecoration.none,
    letterSpacing: 0.3,
  );
  
  AppTextStyles._();
}
```

## Example Usage

Once you have run the exporter against your design system, you can start using the code in your codebase right away. Here are a few examples of how you can use the output of the Flutter exporter:

### Using a text style


```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../text_styles.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Center(
        child: Text(
          "Hello, world!",
          style: AppTextStyles.text11RegularItalic,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Installing

You can generate all production ready-code either manually using Supernova's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SupernovaIO.pulsar-vsc-extension), or automate your code delivery pipeline using Supernova [Design Continuous Delivery](https://supernova.io/automated-code-delivery). In order to make the Supernova Flutter exporter available for your organization so you can start generating code from your design system, please follow the installation guide in our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/using-exporters/installing-exporters).
