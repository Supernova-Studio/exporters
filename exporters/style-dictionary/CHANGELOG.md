### ðŸš€ New

This is the initial release of the Style Dictionary Exporter. The exporter is built on the new export engine and is part of the Pulsar 2.0 release.

The Style Dictionary exporter comes with extensive configuration options that allow you to customize the output format. Before modifying the code itself, check the configuration options - it's likely you can achieve your desired output through configuration alone.

The generated output is compatible with Style Dictionary's token format, allowing seamless integration into your design systems and applications.

Key features include:
- Support for all token types (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Flexible theming support
- Multiple color format options (HEX, RGB, HSL, OKLCH)
- Customizable file organization
