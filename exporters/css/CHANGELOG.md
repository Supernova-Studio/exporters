### ðŸš€ New

This is a major release of the CSS Exporter. The entire exporter was rewritten from scratch, and it is now based on the new export engine. This release is a part of the Pulsar 2.0 release. 

The CSS exporter now comes with a configuration file, which allows you to customize the output. The configuration file is located at ./src/config.ts. Before you start tinkering with the code itself, try to adjust the configuration options to fit your needs - it is very likely the exporter can do it exactly as you want.
