### ðŸš€ New

This is the initial release of the CSS in JS Exporter. The exporter is built on the new export engine and is part of the Pulsar 2.0 release.

The CSS in JS exporter comes with extensive configuration options that allow you to customize the output format. Before modifying the code itself, check the configuration options - it's likely you can achieve your desired output through configuration alone.

The generated output is compatible with popular CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion and Styled Components, allowing seamless integration into your applications.

Key features include:
- Support for all token types (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Multiple color format options (HEX, RGB, HSL, OKLCH)
- Various token naming conventions (camelCase, constantCase, etc.)
- Flexible theming and branding support
- Customizable file organization
